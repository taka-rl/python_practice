'''
In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a child class or derived class. 
Suppose three classes A, B, C. 
A is the superclass, B is the child class of A, C is the child class of B. 
In other words, we can say a chain of classes is called multilevel inheritance.
'''

# Base class
class Vehicle:
    def Vehicle_info(self):
        print("Inside Vehicle class")

# Child class
class Car(Vehicle):
    def car_info(self):
        print("Inside Car class")

# Child class
class SportsCar(Car):
    def sports_car_info(self):
        print("Inside SportsCar class")

# Create object of SportsCar
s_car = SportsCar()

# acess Vehicle's and Car info using SportsCar object
s_car.Vehicle_info()
s_car.car_info()
s_car.sports_car_info()

'''
In the above example, we can see there are three classes named Vehicle, Car, SportsCar.
Vehicle is the superclass, Car is a child of Vehicle, SportsCar is a child of Car. 
So we can see the chaining of classes.
