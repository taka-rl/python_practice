'''
Using the class method, we can only access or modify the class variables. 
Letâ€™s see how to access and modify the class variables in the class method.
Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. 
Using the class method we can modify the class state by changing the value of a class variable that would apply across all the class objects.

# Example 3: Access Class Variables in Class Methods

class Student:
    school_name = "ABC School"
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    @classmethod
    def change_school(cls, school_name):
        # class_name.class_variable
        cls.school_name = school_name
    
    # instance method
    def show(self):
        print(self.name, self.age, "School:", Student.school_name)

jessa = Student("Jessa", 20)
jessa.show()

# change school_name
Student.change_school("XYZ School")
jessa.show()
