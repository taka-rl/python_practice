Exercise 3: Get Only unique items from two sets
Write a Python program to return a new set 
with unique items from both sets by removing duplicates.

Given:
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:
{70, 40, 10, 50, 20, 60, 30}
'''

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
ans = set1 | set2
print(ans)

print(set1.union(set2))
